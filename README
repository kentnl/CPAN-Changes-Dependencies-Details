CPAN::Changes::Dependencies::Details

This module serves as a utility for producing complex change-logs in
"CPAN::Changes" style, specifically tailored to conveying the nature of
dependency changes between releases.

It typically requires some mechanism external to this code to report the
state of prerequisites at given versions, where it computes their
differences and produces sections detailing the kinds of changes you
have elected to itemize.
